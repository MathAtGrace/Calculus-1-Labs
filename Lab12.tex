		\question[5] Two poles, one 6 meters tall and one 15 meters tall, are 20 meters apart.  A length of wire is attached to the top of each pole and it is also staked to the ground somewhere between the two poles so that the wire is pulled tight.  Where should the wire be staked so that the minimum amount of wire is used?
		
		\question[5] Find the absolute maximum for the volume of an open box formed by cutting out squares from the corners of a piece of paper and fold up to form an open box.  Remember this one from lab 1?  Do it with calculus now.
		
		\question[5] A taxi company transfers 400 people each day at \$30 per customer per day.  They estimate that for every \$1 increase results in the loss of 20 customers.  What price should they charge to maximize revenue?  What would the maximum revenue be?
