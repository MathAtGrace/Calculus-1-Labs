    "# Continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of limit analysis relates to a concept known as continuity. A function is said to be continuous on an interval when the function is defined at every point on that interval and undergoes no interruptions, jumps, or breaks. If some function f(x) satisfies these criteria from x=a to x=b, for example, we say that f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b]. The brackets mean that the interval is closed -- that it includes the endpoints a and b. In other words, that the interval is defined as a ≤ x ≤ b. An open interval (a, b), on the other hand, would not include endpoints a and b, and would be defined as a < x < b.\n",

    "The function f(x) in the graph is known as a piecewise function, or one that has multiple, well, pieces. As you can see, the function travels from x=0 to x=3 without interruption, and since the two endpoints are closed (designated by the filled-in black circles), f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 3]. To think of it another way, if you can trace a function on an interval without picking up your pen (and without running over any holes), the function is continuous on that interval.\n",

    "One of the more important theorems relating to continuous functions is the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that if a function f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and k is any number between f(a) and f(b), then there must exist at least one number c such that f(c) = k. In other words, if f is continuous on [a, b], it must pass through every y-value bounded by f(a) and f(b). In the continuous function graphed above, for example, f(0) = 0 and f(3) = 2, so f(x) must pass through all y-values bounded by and including 0 and 2 on the interval [0, 3], which as one can see, it does.\n",
