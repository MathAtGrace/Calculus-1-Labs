    "So far, we have looked at the behavior of two types of functions as x approaches positive or negative infinity: those with horizontal asymptotes, and those that oscillate indefinitely. The third type we are going to cover is slant asymptotes. Also known as oblique asymptotes, slant asymptotes are invisible, diagonal lines suggested by a function's curve that approach a certain slope as x approaches positive or negative infinity. The following graph is one such function:\n",

    "It looks like f(x) starts to approach a certain slope rather than a certain y-value to both sides of the vertical asymptote. As in the last section, this function gives the suggestion of an invisible line separating the top and bottom portions of the graph. In this case, the invisible line is a slant asymptote. The question here is not of which value the function approaches, but of which slope it approaches as x becomes increasingly large or small. To answer this question, let's do a little numerical analysis. Evaluate the following code."
