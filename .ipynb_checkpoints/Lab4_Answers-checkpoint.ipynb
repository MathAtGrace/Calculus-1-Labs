    "You are a scientist studying the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii, which is the world’s most continuously active volcano.  Very active volcanoes characteristically eject red-hot rocks and lava rather than smoke and ash.  As you watch the volcano from a safe distance with your friend, a reporter, you see that Kilauea ejects a giant rock through the air.  Being a good scientist, you have your stopwatch handy, and you see that the rock takes 17 seconds to fall back to earth.  You and your reporter friend go to examine the rock, and you see that it landed approximately 234 meters lower than the top of the volcano.  Your friend wants to write an article about what just happened, and they want to include in their article how high the rock went and how fast it was shot out of the volcano.  Use your formula for falling projectiles to determine how high the rock went.  Kilauea Volcano is 1247 meters above sea level.\n",
