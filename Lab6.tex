		\question[5] You have a bicyclist riding his bike at 2ft./sec on a bridge that is 6ft. tall traveling east.  You have a kayaker paddling under the bridge at 3ft./sec traveling south.  The kayaker arrives directly under the center of the bridge 1 second before the bike reaches the center of the bridge.  They both travel for 4 seconds after the bike passes the center of the bridge.  How fast are they separating?
		
		\question[10] You and a friend are in front of the Science Building.  You head inside for Calculus class and your friend walks to Jazzmanâ€™s to grab some coffee.  How quickly is the distance between you and your friend increasing after 5 seconds, assuming that you both walk in straight lines for those 5 seconds?  (Hint:  Law of Cosines)
		
		\question[10] Fire a nerf gun in the air and film the entire flight from 20 ft away.  Let $\theta$ be the angle between your line-of-sight of the nerf dart and the floor.  What is the rate of change of the angle in terms of t?
